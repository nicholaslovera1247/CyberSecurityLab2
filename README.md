This file is a test case file testing 2 functions from an authentication file for a private web page. There are 10 test cases in this file, testing the database authentication function
of the authentication file and the password strength function from the authentication file. To run this program correctly, all you have to do is hit the run button and you will see that
both functions pass their respective tests, along with printed statements showing which test cases the functions correctly flagged (this is for verification that no valid cases were passed
as invalid). For some reason, the printed statements do not line up with how their test cases are, but nonetheless the cases pass properly and the printed statements are correct.
